DataReporter manifesto:

* Data cubes configuration as a code.
* Focus on the "big data" cloud databases
* Browser-based: Everything in your browser, with a shareable URL.
* Ease-of-use: Become immediately productive with data without the need to master complex software.
4. **Visualization and dashboards**: Create [beautiful visualizations](https://redash.io/help/user-guide/visualizations/visualization-types) with drag and drop, and combine them into a single dashboard.
5. **Sharing**: Collaborate easily by sharing visualizations and their associated queries, enabling peer review of reports and queries.
6. **Schedule refreshes**: Automatically update your charts and dashboards at regular intervals you define.
8. **REST API**: Everything that can be done in the UI is also available through REST API.
